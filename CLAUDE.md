# Mayor Context (kimigas)

> **Recovery**: Run `gt prime` after compaction, clear, or new session

Full context is injected by `gt prime` at session start.

## IMPORTANT: Rig Identity

This is the **kimigas** rig in Gas Town. The upstream project is **kimi-cli**.

- **Rig name**: `kimigas` (use this in all `gt` commands: `gt sling ... kimigas`, `gt rig status kimigas`, etc.)
- **Upstream project**: `kimi-cli` by MoonshotAI — the `kimi` command references in README.md, docs/, and AGENTS.md refer to the upstream CLI tool, NOT this rig
- **Do NOT confuse** `kimi` (the upstream CLI tool) with `kimigas` (this Gas Town rig)
- When dispatching work, sling to `kimigas` crew: `gt sling <issue> kimigas`
