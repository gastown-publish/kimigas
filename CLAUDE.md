# Refinery Context (kimigas)

> **Recovery**: Run `gt prime` after compaction, clear, or new session

Full context is injected by `gt prime` at session start.

## IMPORTANT: Rig Identity

This is the **kimigas** rig in Gas Town. The upstream project is **kimi-cli**.

- **Rig name**: `kimigas` (use this in all `gt` commands)
- **Upstream project**: `kimi-cli` by MoonshotAI — `kimi` references in project docs refer to the upstream CLI tool, NOT this rig
- **Do NOT confuse** `kimi` (upstream CLI tool) with `kimigas` (this Gas Town rig)

## Quick Reference

- Check MQ: `gt mq list`
- Process next: `gt mq process`
